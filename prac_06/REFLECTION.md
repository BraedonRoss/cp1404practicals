# CP1404 Practical Reflection


## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?
I aim to now fully understand each week of content and note question that I have on content that I dont understand. 
This is so by the time the lecture comes around, I have the ability to ask these questions (if not covered in the lecture)
and understand everything to the best of my ability.


## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I need to find motivation to do work tasks more consistently throughout the week and utilise my time more efficiently. 
Currently my best motivation is to wait for a deadline which is an unhealthy study habit.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Understanding the content throughout the weeks and not blindly taking notes helps my studies alot, especially when
attending lectures as it allows me to deepen my learning rather than trying to understand new content.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to allocated more time to my uni schedule and needing to ask more work availabilities, to have more 
time to focus and commit myself to my studies.


## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I wish the other IT lectures were as interested and on top of there subject as much as Lindsay is. Furthermore, the
classes where the lecturer is a located on the cairns campus can be quite hard to follow and listen to effectively.
