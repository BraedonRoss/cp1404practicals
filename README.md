# CP1404 Practicals

## braedon.ross@my.jcu.edu.au

This repository serves as a way for my progress towards practicals to be tracked. With every week focusing on a new
Python skill this repo will be useful to look back on, even with the continuation of my studies.

## 3 main lessons I have learned about "clean code"

- Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY), This principle helps to avoid bad patterns.
- Always pressing command + option + L when working in a file, ideally before a commit.
- Correct naming when writing functions, classes, docstrings, commits ect... with the latter 2, imperative mood is
  usually the key.
