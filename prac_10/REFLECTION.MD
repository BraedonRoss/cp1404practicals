# CP1404 Practical Reflection


## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimates where somewhat accurate, usually within ~5 minutes.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

Not a great amount, however I believe this is due to each week offering something new to learn. So I was unfamiliar with the different processes of writing each different types of code.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned that I am quite bad at estimating how long my code will take to write. Furthermore, I also learnt that properly thinking about code before writing it significantly decreases the amount of time it took me to write the code.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

The code review I received from other people unfortunately turned out to not be that constructive, however I believed if it were done well it would be quite helpful in writing better code.
### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

From doing code reviews I have learnt how to better navigate Github, but I have also learnt that alot of people struggle with iterative code development and writing using proper coding constructs.


### Good Code Review 1

[Prac 7 Code Review](https://github.com/Ornysha/cp1404practicals/pull/2)

### Explanation

This code review I believe was quite thorough, I made sure to go through each file and constructively point out things that could have been worked on. This code review however could have been formatted better using all the tools that Github had to offer.

### Good Code Review 2

[Prac 8 Code Review](https://github.com/MoeKhant7711/cp1404Practicals/pull/3)

### Explanation

This code review I believe could have been more concise, due to the nature of the prac being rather simple this was quite difficult. However, I believe that the review I provided was able to effectively point out constructive criticisms and communicate them in a way that wasnt harsh or rude. 

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

The only change I would have made with the practicals is to try and keep the length of them consistent between the weeks. Some of the practicals took around 45 mins to an hour however others could take upwards of 3 hours. This just made it difficult at times to know how much time to allocate to pracs week to week.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I felt that I properly understood what was expected of me each week. Everything was explained in a way that made it simple to follow, or to find what was needed with relative ease.
